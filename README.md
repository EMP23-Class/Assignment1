# Assignment0

This is a very simple preliminary assignment to get you familiar with the github classroom submission process, and a little bit of Mathematical Programming in Julia.

# Basic Instructions

After getting julia installed on your computer, and familiarizing yourself with the basics, complete the function "optimize" in src/tragedy.jl.

You can test your implementation by following these steps:

1. Change directory to the root of Assignment0
2. Start julia via the command `julia --project`
3. Press `]` to enter `pkg` mode. Here, install package dependencies by running
   `instantiate`. Note, you only need to instantiate the project the first time
   you start up Julia in this way. 
4. In `pkg` mode, simply type `test` to run the tests. Revise your code until
   tests pass.
